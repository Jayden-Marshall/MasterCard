<h1>Mastercard Virtual Internship</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

I participated in Mastercard's Security Awareness Team internship program, focusing on phishing simulations. It was an awesome experience to take the lead on crafting a believable phishing email for our next campaign.  I learned a lot about the different ways phishers try to trick employees and how to craft emails that are contextual, relevant, and believable without being malicious.  By understanding these tactics, we can design simulations that effectively train our colleagues to identify and avoid real phishing attempts.
